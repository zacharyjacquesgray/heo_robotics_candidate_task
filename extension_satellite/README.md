# Satellite Tracker

Used React.js to quickly put together a satellite tracking feature from TLE data. Currently, it is using 21 July 2023 data, and may be updated to use the API to call the data for any satellite since the TLE data is all that's needed.

The application is pinpointing the coordinates of the International Space Station in real time (1 second increments), as well as the previous and future ~45 minutes of its ground path.
